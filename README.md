This repository uses the Pheweb code base (Gagliano Taliun, S.A., VandeHaar, P. et al. Exploring and visualizing large-scale genetic associations by using PheWeb. Nat Genet 52, 550â€“552 (2020).) to display results of hundreds of genome-wide associations analyses for 871 time-to-event phenotypes based on the White British participants in the UK Biobank. The analyses used imputed genotypes based on the UK10K and Haplotype Reference Consortium (HRC) panels. The analyses were conducted using GATE (an efficient frailty model-based association test that uses the saddlepoint approximation to account for heavy censoring), controlling for genetic relatedness, sex, birth year, and the first four genetic principal components. All genomic positions are according to GRCh37 assembly.
